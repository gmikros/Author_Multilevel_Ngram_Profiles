### Multilevel N-grams for authorship attribution and profiling

This is an R script for calculating sequential character n-gram vectors in a corpus of texts. These vectors are used for training SVM and Random Forests MC algorithms in order to perfrom authorship attribution or author profiling classification.
AMNP method has been described in the following papers:
